# Mistake Pitches

Files for a project trying to define and evaluate so-called "mistake pitches" in the 2021 MLB Season. This repo currently contains the mistakes.R file which contains all code for various models and plots, as well as comments about the modeling process. There is also an .Rmd file which contains much of the same code, used to generate the pdf which contains the writeup and final plots. Once I can get the html output from the .rmd file to properly show up on Github that will be the best way to read the report, I hope to have this done soon. All data used is from [Baseball Savant](http://baseballsavant.com/) and was originally scraped using the [baseballr](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) package.
